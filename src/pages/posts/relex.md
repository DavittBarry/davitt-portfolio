# My time at RELEX: growing as an Application Support Analyst

Since joining RELEX Solutions in March 2024, I've had the opportunity to work with some of the world's leading retailers while developing both my technical and problem-solving skills in enterprise software support.

## What I do

As an Application Support Analyst at RELEX, I'm part of the team that ensures retail planning systems run smoothly for major international retailers. Every day brings different challenges:

- **Incident management**: Handling priority issues and ensuring swift resolution.
- **Technical troubleshooting**: Working with various technologies from databases to file transfer systems.
- **Customer communication**: Keeping clients informed during critical situations.
- **Process improvement**: Identifying opportunities to work more efficiently.

The variety of work keeps me constantly learning. One moment I'm analyzing system logs, the next I'm coordinating with different teams to resolve complex technical issues.

## Skills I've developed

Working in enterprise support has accelerated my technical growth:

- **Monitoring and observability**: Using industry-standard tools for log analysis and alerting.
- **Programming**: Writing/using automation scripts in Python and working with Java.
- **Cloud technologies**: Getting hands-on experience with Azure and AWS.
- **Problem-solving**: Learning to quickly identify root causes in complex systems.
- **Communication**: Translating technical issues for various stakeholders.

## Making an impact

One of the most rewarding aspects of my role has been identifying inefficiencies and proposing solutions. I noticed our team was spending significant time on repetitive documentation tasks during escalations.

This led me to work on an automation project using AI to streamline these processes. The solution reduces what used to take 30-45 minutes down to just a couple of minutes, allowing our team to focus more on solving problems rather than documenting them.

Being selected for our AI innovation initiatives has been a highlight of my journey so far. It's exciting to be part of transforming how support operations work in the modern enterprise.

## Looking ahead

At about just over 1.5 years in, I'm energized by the learning opportunities ahead. My focus is on continuing to deliver value while building expertise in:

- Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices.
- Infrastructure automation.
- Technical consulting.
- Advanced troubleshooting methodologies.

RELEX has shown me that innovation often comes from those closest to the daily challenges. Every repetitive task is a potential automation opportunity, and every pattern in incidents is a chance to prevent future issues.

## Key takeaways

- Enterprise support is about more than fixing issues; it's about understanding business impact.
- The best improvements come from experiencing the pain points firsthand.
- Combining technical skills with business awareness creates real value.
- There's always room to innovate, even in established processes.

Working at RELEX has reinforced my belief that technology should make our work more efficient and meaningful. I'm excited to continue growing in this role and contributing to our team's success.
