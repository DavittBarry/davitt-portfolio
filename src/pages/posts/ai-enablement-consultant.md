# New chapter: AI Enablement Consultant

Starting February 2026, I'm moving into a new role at RELEX Solutions as an AI Enablement Consultant. After nearly two years in 24/7 Support, this feels like a natural next step.

## What the role involves

The AI Enablement team sits within Global Service Delivery, working across Support and Service Delivery functions. The job is about finding where AI can genuinely help people work better:

- **Requirements gathering**: Understanding what teams actually need, not just what they ask for.
- **Solution design**: Building AI agents that solve real problems.
- **Adoption**: Making sure what gets built actually gets used.
- **Measurement**: Tracking whether solutions deliver real time savings.

It's part business consulting, part prompt engineering, part change management. The technical build is often the easy part. Getting people to trust and adopt new tools is where it gets interesting.

## How I got here

During my time in Support, I joined an AI proof-of-concept group and built an automation tool that reduced a repetitive documentation task from 30-60 minutes down to about 2 minutes. That project taught me something important: a technically sound solution means nothing if people don't use it.

The experience also showed me this is the kind of work I want to focus on full-time. Identifying inefficiencies, designing solutions, and measuring impact. The new role lets me do exactly that.

## What's ahead

The team is new and small, which means there's room to shape how things are done. My focus for the first few months:

- Learning the team's methodology inside out.
- Building relationships with stakeholders across different functions.
- Delivering early wins that demonstrate value.
- Getting adoption right from the start.

I already know the Support function well from my current role, so I'll be building on that foundation while expanding into Service Delivery.

## Key takeaways

- The best opportunities often come from experiencing problems firsthand.
- Building something is easier than getting people to use it.
- AI works best when it removes tedious work, not when it tries to replace human judgment.
- New roles in new teams mean you can help define how things are done.

I'm looking forward to this next chapter. Smaller team, focused work, and the chance to build things that actually make a difference.
