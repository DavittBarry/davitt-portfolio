## Introduction

Hello, I'm Davitt Barry! If you've been following my work or have just stumbled upon this blog, welcome. Today I'd like to share a bit about my current situation, the skills I've honed over the years, and the fact that I'm open to new opportunities in the web development field.

## My Current Role at Mysteerio Oy

I'm currently employed with Mysteerio Oy until September 28, 2023. Due to economic reasons within the company, I will be available for new opportunities after this date. Mysteerio Oy has been kind enough to offer to serve as a reference and can vouch for my abilities. During my time at Mysteerio, I've been responsible for various tasks including website management, development and more.

## Skills and Experience

I transitioned back into IT and web development four years ago after a 15-year background in music. Here are some of the skills I've honed:

- **Programming**: Proficient in PHP, WordPress, Laravel, React, Astro, Vue.js, HTML, SQL, CSS, SASS, Tailwind, MySQL, MongoDB, Next.js, Express, Node.js, and Drupal.
- **Other Technical Skills**: Command-line usage across various platforms, Linux/Windows, version control (Git, GitHub & BitBucket), setting up and configuring web servers like Apache and Nginx, RESTful APIs/endpoints, and cloud platforms like AWS.

## Open for New Opportunities

I'm excited about the prospect of leveraging my diverse skill set in a new role. If you have an interesting project or are looking for someone to join your team, feel free to [contact me](mailto:davittbarry333@gmail.com).
